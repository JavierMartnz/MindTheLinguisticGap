####### PRE-PROCESSING ################

It is important to keep this order, since files from the Corpus NGT pre-processing are needed for the second step.

1. split_resize_cngt.py
    Corpus NGT videos come in pairs, so this scripts split the ones that need splitting. Additionally, it resizes
    them to 256x256 pixels and ensures that the framerate is 25fps.

2. get_signbank_vocab.py
    Gets all glosses in Signbank together with their corresponding ID and saves them in a dictionary.

3. get_cngt_glosses_vocab_and_splits.py
    Processes the annotation files to get all glosses in file and extracts the vocabulary from the whole CNGT. Once
    done, it splits the gloss, annotations, and videos into train/val/test splits ONLY for videos with annotations.

4. resize_signbank.py
    Resizes Signbank videos to 256x256 pixels and framerate 25 fps, creates folder and zip file. Needed for the
    training of the I3D model.

5. filter_signbank.py
    Filters out the videos of signs that do not appear in the CNGT, creates folder and zip file. Needed for the
    trainig of the transformer model

5. trim_signs_cngt.py
    To pre-train the I3D network, videos containing only one annotated sign are needed. Trim these clips by checking
    first their presence in the signbank vocabulary. Done only for training fold of the
    CNGT data.

6. preprocess_windows.py
    For every cngt clip trimed previously, creates a gzip with the necessary window information for data loading during
    the training. Zips the entire folder containing
